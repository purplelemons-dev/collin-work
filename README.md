programming i've done for Collin College as a student employee

## Youtube Transcript Getter
Hosts a simple webserver that allows users to provide YouTube links and uses OpenAI's [Whisper](https://openai.com/research/whisper) model to get a highly accurate transcript. This is used on Collin's YouTube [channel](https://youtube.com/@CougarEDU) for hearing-impared students. Look at it [here](./yt-py)

## Handshake Integration
In order for the carreer center to quickly integrate with new employers, I designed a [program](./matchingemployers.py) to filter through a large excel document to find relevant data.

## Phone
Even though it wasn't used, I designed a [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us) integration in order to quickly reach hundreds of students at the push of a button. Look at it [here](./phone.py)
